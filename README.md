# SeleniumPythonExample

This repository will serve as an example of how Selenium works in conjunction with the Firefox web driver, in order to test web pages and GUIs. It is also a bit of a playground for me to improve my skills with Selenium.

### Requirements

* Python
    * This example uses version 2.7.12
* Selenium
    * ```pip install selenium```
    * If ```pip``` is not installed, run ```apt-get install python-pip (for Ubuntu/Debian systems)
* Geckodriver
   * Good install guide/script can be found [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/870530/how-to-install-geckodriver-in-ubuntu)
    
### Running the Tests

```python seleniumPythonTest```

### Expected Output

All the tests should pass. At the moment, there should be no output other than that generated by Selenium after the completion of the tests.

### Notes
It was taking an unusually long time to run a simple test that clicks the "I'm feeling lucky" button on google (38+ seconds). Discovered that it was because the page that it goes to (Ookla speed test) has a bunch of ads that take forever to load. I didn't notice when I checked the site out, because I have adblocker. Selenium waits for the page to load completely before it does anything (understandably). Changed the search to "python" and it is way faster now.
